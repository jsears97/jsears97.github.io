	<p> <font face=verdana> One of the most popular esports is League of Legends obviously based on viewership numbers. Just because it is the most popular doesn't mean that it doesnt have it's own woes for generating profit for certain leagues within the esport.</font> </p>
	<p> Esports is growing courtesy of external sources investing into the infrastructure of organizations. Teams from the NBA have invested into organizations while others have invested in the infrastructure of others. While football clubs based out of Europe have started to build their own esports branches in their own clubs. This influx of investment from external sources has boosted revenue for organizations involved but the gap may be spreading between organizations now much like the gap in other professional sports until revenue sharing was implemented in many of the leagues. With organizations gaining outside investment they have a larger source of income and can pay players more and thus inflate the already increasy cost of salaries. </p>
